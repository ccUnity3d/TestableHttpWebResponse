About
=======================================

Testing libraries that talk to external HTTP APIs in .Net is difficult to
do. The testable classes have been designed to allow you to setup expected
Request and Responses ahead of time so you can exercise API logic in unit tests
rather than by manual test or talking to a live, networked resource.

* TestableHttpWebResponse - The Testable classes
* TestableHttpWebResponse.Sample - Sample API consumer
* TestableHttpWebResponse.Sample.Tests - Tests of the SampleService using the Testable classes
